Nodes: A node is a machine, physical or virtual on which Kubernetes is installed. A node is a worker machine and that is where containers will be launched by Kubernetes.

Cluster: a set of nodes grouped together, if one node fails, the application still accessible, multiple nodes also help sharing loads

Master: another node with Kubernetes installed in it and is configured as a Master.The master watches over the nodes in the cluster and is responsible for the actual orchestration of containers on the worker nodes.
